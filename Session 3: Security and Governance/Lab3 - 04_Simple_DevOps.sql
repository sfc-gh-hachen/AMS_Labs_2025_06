/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 - Create Development Environment Using Zero-Copy Cloning

Zero-copy cloning creates a copy of a database, schema or table without duplicating 
the actual data. A snapshot of data present in the source object is taken when the 
clone is created and is made available to the cloned object.

Key Benefits:
- Instant database duplication
- No additional storage cost initially
- Independent writable copy for development
- Safe testing environment

CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE AMS_LABS_DEV CLONE AMS_LABS;

            the source object is taken when the clone is created and is made available to the cloned object. 
           
            The cloned object is writable and is independent of the clone source. That is, changes made to
            either the source object or the clone object are not part of the other. Cloning a database will
            clone all the schemas and tables within that database. Cloning a schema will clone all the
            tables in that schema.

        TIME-TRAVEL: enables accessing historical data (i.e. data that has been changed or deleted) at any point within
          a defined period. It serves as a powerful tool for performing the following tasks:
          - Restoring data-related objects (tables, schemas, and databases) that might have been accidentally or intentionally deleted.
          - Duplicating and backing up data from key points in the past.
          - Analyzing data usage/manipulation over specified periods of time.
